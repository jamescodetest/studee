## To run:
In the command line, type:

```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```
Then, in the web browser, visit `http://localhost:80`

## Assumptions:
* Assumed that the search fields should behave as "AND" instead of "OR"
* Assumed that the language in the search can just be the language code rather than the language name
* Assumed that country data does not change so does not need to be updated at any point once in the database
